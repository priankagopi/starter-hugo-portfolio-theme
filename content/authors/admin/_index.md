A dedicated and results-driven data science and engineering professional, equipped with a strong academic background and a genuine passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems. Currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine learning, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment. 



Outside of the data realm, I am an avid learner and continuously seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set. I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and society and strive to contribute to the development of cutting-edge solutions that have a meaningful impact on businesses and society as a whole. Apart from work, I love reading and absolutely enjoy being outdoors surrounded by nature as much as possible.
