I am Priyanka Gopi, a graduate student pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (UCF).

Equipped with skills and a strong understanding of Python, I am keenly interested in learning more about the fields of Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I’m creative, analytical, and strategic in my ways and thrive on adapting to and succeeding in problem-solving and complex, challenging environments. I also take pride in having the ability to look at the big picture while having an eye for attention to detail simultaneously.

Beyond the world of data, I'm also an avid artist, finding inspiration in blending creativity with analytics. I look forward to bringing this unique blend of skills to contribute to innovative projects and a community that values both artistry and data-driven insights.

Words I live by: Keep Learning and Growing. Be Kind and Helpful. Always Create Value.

Currently, I am open to exciting internship/full-time roles in Software Engineering/Data Engineering/Machine Learning and would love to hear more about it. If you're passionate about data and related areas, don't hesitate to connect. I'm always up for engaging conversations and the chance to learn from fellow enthusiasts.
